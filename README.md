gprs_sniff
==========

This repo will contain stuff I create while trying out GPRS sniffing based on Karsten Nohl's and Luca Melette's
presentation and tutorial:

https://srlabs.de/gprs

It currently contains an updated version of the patch needed to enable GPRS-sniffing with OsmocomBB.
This patch works with the latest burst_ind branch of Sylvain Munaut.


Credits and everything goes to the great people behind the tutorial and the Osmocom project, thank you!
